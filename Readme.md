# How to emulate a TreeList  using the master-detail GridView


<p>This example demonstrates how to override the GridView painting mechanism, and draw lines within the master row indent area, to link a master row with detail rows, like the TreeList does for parent node and its children.<br><br></p>
<p>Starting with version 16.1.4, <strong>Grid</strong> supports the embedded details mode that can be enabled using the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraGridViewsGridGridOptionsDetail_DetailModetopic.aspx">DetailMode</a> property. Download version 16.1.4 or higher if you are using this mode.</p>
